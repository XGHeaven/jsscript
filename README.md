Inspired by [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs).

## Goal

- Provide a easy way to learning JavaScript engine. No needs to learn C.
- Only support `strict mode` and modern JavaScript feature.
    - Such as `let`, `const`, `async`, `await`, `arrow function`, `class`, etc.
    - Not implement `with`, `eval`, `var`, etc.
- Please do not using this project for your production without any tested.
